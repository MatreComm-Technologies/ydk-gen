Description: An SDK that provides API's that are modeled in YANG.
 The main goal of YDK is to reduce the learning curve of YANG data
 models by expressing the model semantics in an API and abstracting
 protocol/encoding details. YDK is composed of a core package that
 defines services and providers, plus one or more module bundles that
 are based on YANG models. Each module bundle is generated using a
 bundle profile and the ydk-gen tool.
