Using Restconf with HTTPS
=========================

By default the RestconfServiceProvider initializes to support HTTP non-secure protocol.
But YDK also provides partial support for HTTPS protocol. Here 'partial' means that YDK is capable communicate over secure protocol,
provides data encryption, checks Restconf server CA certificate, but the peer and host name verifications are permanently disabled.
This limitation should be addressed in future YDK releases.

In order to enable HTTPS protocol, the user must obtain and install the Restconf server CA certificate on application server.
In Ubuntu the installation procedure is as followed:

CA Certificate Installation
---------------------------

In order to enable HTTPS protocol, the user must obtain and install the Restconf server CA certificate on application server.
On Ubuntu the installation procedure is as followed:

.. code-block:: sh

    cd /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
    sudo mkdir ydk
    cp ~/myrestconf.crt ydk/
    # Make sure the permissions are OK (755 for the folder, 644 for the file)
    sudo update-ca-certificates
    # In the output of the last command check that the certificate was added

The installation procedure on CentOS-7:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo cp ~/myrestconf.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
    sudo update-ca-trust

Getting MacOS to trust self-signed SSL Certificates:

 1. Locate your CA certificate file.
 2. Open up Keychain Access.
 3. Drag your certificate into Keychain Access.
 4. Go into the Certificates section and locate the certificate you just added.
 5. Double click on it, enter the trust section and under “When using this certificate” select “Always Trust”.


Code Snippet
------------

In the application the user must explicitly specify HTTPS protocol in the host address.
The following example shows, how the RestconfServiceProvider is used to read names of all interfaces from secure Restconf server:

.. code-block:: c++
 :linenos:

 #include <ydk/types.hpp>
 #include <ydk/restconf_provider.hpp>
 #include <ydk/crud_service.hpp>
 #include "ydk/path_api.hpp"
 
 #include <ydk_openconfig/openconfig_interfaces.hpp>
 
 using namespace ydk;
 using namespace openconfig;
 using namespace std;
 
 int main(int argc, char* argv[])
 {
    auto repo = path::Repository("/home/ygorelik/.ydk/ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com");
    RestconfServiceProvider provider(repo,
                                     "https://myrestconf.server.com",   // add 'https://' prefix to the host name or address
                                     "admin-user", "admin-password",
                                     443,     // HTTPS port
                                     EncodingFormat::JSON);
    auto interfaces = openconfig_interfaces::Interfaces{};

    CrudService crud{};
    auto reply = crud.read(provider, interfaces);
    auto all_interfaces = dynamic_cast<openconfig_interfaces::Interfaces*>(reply.get());

    for (auto intf_entity : all_interfaces->interface.entities())
    {
        auto intf = dynamic_cast<openconfig_interfaces::Interfaces::Interface*>(intf_entity.get());
        cout << intf->name << endl;
    }
 }
